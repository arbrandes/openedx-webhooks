.. A new scriv changelog fragment.

- Rescanning never considers pull requests created before 2018.  This is a
  quick fix to deal with contractor comments.

  Because we don't track when companies started and stopped being contractors,
  we can't decide now if a pull request should have had a contractor comment
  when it was created.

  The latest contractor comment on one of our pull requests was in December
  2017.  So don't consider pull requests that old.  Later we can implement a
  better solution if we need to rescan those old pull requests.
